          <ul>
          <li>  Richard Phillips Feynman was a prominent American scientist, widely considered to be one of the greatest and most influential theoretical physicists in history.</li>
          <li>
            Framed for his brilliant mind and mercurial personality, his main work was in quantum physics and particle physics
          </li>

            On October 21, 1965, Caltech's Richard Feynman shared the Nobel Prize in Physics with Julian Schwinger and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga. The three independently brokered workable marriages between 20th-century quantum mechanics and 19th-century electromagnetic field theory.

          <li>
            In the late 1940s, Richard Feynman invented a visual tool for simplifying particle calculations that forever changed theoretical physics

            An incident on the day of his greatest achievement 
            Back in the 1960s, Nobel laureates got a congratulatory 9:00 a.m. telegram from Stockholm rather than a 3:00 a.m. phone call. Even so, Feynman was awakened at 3:45 a.m. by a reporter who broke the news to him, then asked, "Aren't you pleased to hear that you've won the prize?" "I could have found out later this morning," the groggy Feynman replied. "Well, how do you feel, now that you've won it?" the reporter persisted.
